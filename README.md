# Lego-Games-Character-List  

This page aims to collect the list of characters in lego games.  
So we can know which characters are unused and present in the game files.  
The lists can be used to complete "The Cutting Room Floor" pages or for those who want to modify the game to play these characters.

### Can I contribute?  
Yes! Unused characters with a .TXT file should be tested to see if they work.  
To test, add the character's name in "COLLECTION.TXT".  
Depending on whether it works or not, replace ❓ by ✅ or ❌.
  
### Can I suggest a game?
Yes! Create an issue with your suggestion.
